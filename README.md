# GestureBot
Project for ECE 5725 at Cornell

robot_FINAL.py was our completed software script that ran on the Pi Zero W for the robot.
gesture_detect_FINAL.py was our completed software script that ran on the Pi 3 for the base station.

Files in /test are individual scripts we wrote to test/debug various hardware components in isolation from the system as a whole.
